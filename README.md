# SilkJs

SilkJS is client side implementation of [SilkFlow](https://github.com/esensible/silkflow). Both are fine grained reactive libraries targetting the Kindle (specifically the PaperWhite).

Unless you're specifically targetting old browsers and/or the kindle, then you're better off looking at something like [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) which is way more considered, better implemented and more mature - not to mentioned actively supported.

That said, if you're looking to rock that Kindle for its awesome, low cost, daylight readable, backlit, IP67 display then welcome aboard!!!
