# !! Deprecated !!

The most recent Kindle updates included a relatively decent version of Chromium. My own applications have now ditched silkjs in favour of solidjs, which is actively maintained.

This repo won't receive any further updates. Feel free to fork and go nuts. Go well :)

# SilkJs

SilkJS is client side implementation of [SilkFlow](https://github.com/esensible/silkflow). Both are fine grained reactive libraries targetting the Kindle (specifically the PaperWhite).

Unless you're specifically targetting old browsers and/or the kindle, then you're better off looking at something like [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) which is way more considered, better implemented and more mature - not to mentioned actively supported.

That said, if you're looking to rock that Kindle for its awesome, low cost, daylight readable, backlit, IP67 display then welcome aboard!!!
